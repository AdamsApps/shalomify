<h1>Daily Proclamation</h1>
<p>My body is a  for the Holy Spirit</p>
<p>Redeemed, cleansed and sanctified by the blood of Jesus</p>
<p>My members, the parts of my body, are instruments of righteousness, yielded to God for His service and for His glory</p>
<p>The devil has no place in me, no power over me, no unsettled claims against me</p>
<p>All has been settled by the blood of Jesus</p>
<p>I overcome satan by the blood of the lamb and by the word of my testimony and I do not love my life to the death</p>
<p>My body is for the Lord, and the Lord is for my body.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
